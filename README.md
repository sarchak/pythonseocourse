## Learn Python for optimizing SEO,Marketing & Ads/PPC workflow

In this course you will be learning python and applying those skills to the SEO,Marketing & Ads/PPC workflows. I believe
in learning by doing so most of the concept will be backed by a simple project.

Here are the 5 projects we will be building along the way

   * Autosuggest keywords
   * Broken link checker
   * Visualize internal links
   * Keyword extraction using Keybert
   * Finding similar content/titles
